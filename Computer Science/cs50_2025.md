    Finally get it working. first check results: my actual output has more whitespaces at the end of each line compared with expected results

    second submit done with the help of cs50 duck and https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_strings.php and tutorialspoint (online compiler) to try out printf:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {

        char str[] = "##"; 
        int width = 15; 
        printf("|%*s|  |%s|\n", width, str, str); 

        return 0;
    }
