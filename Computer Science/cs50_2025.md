- common command-line arguments:
    - cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
    - cp, for copying files and directories
    - ls, for listing files in a directory
    - mkdir, for making a directory
    - mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
    - rm, for removing (deleting) files
    - rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories

    Finally get it working. first check results: my actual output has more whitespaces at the end of each line compared with expected results
    https://submit.cs50.io/check50/66be72db646655c3ae5edacf950bb1f8069acdf6

    second submit done with the help of cs50 duck and https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_strings.php and tutorialspoint (online compiler) to try out printf:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {

        char str[] = "##"; 
        int width = 15; 
        printf("|%*s|  |%s|\n", width, str, str); 

        return 0;
    }

### pset5

Two issues:
- memory leak > create_family has a copy paste error where I accidentally set new_person->parent0 = NULL twice
- recursive function

void free_family(person *p)
{
    // TODO: Handle base case: input is null
    if (p == NULL)
    {
        return;
    }

    // TODO: Free parents recursively
    if (!(p->parents[0] == NULL))
    {
        free_family(p->parents[0]);
        free_family(p->parents[1]);
    }
    // TODO: Free child
    else
    {
        free(p);
    }

    //free(p);

}

free(p) should be removed within else, and move to the end

## Notes

### Week 4 memory

> time to get off training wheels <cs50.h>

#### '*' and  '&'

> '*' 声明指针 vs 声明引用
'*' is used to declare pointers and to dereference them.
'&' is used to declare references （引用） and to get the address of a variable.

Without using cs50.h, string s is actually char *s which is the *address* of the first character in an array of characters
When you use s[0], it is actually do *s

char *s = get_string("s: ");
printf("%p\n",s ); // this will print out the value of s, which is the address of the first character in an array of characters
printf("%s\n",s ); // this will print out the input string

#### malloc and free

malloc returns an address, meaning a pointer

char *s = get_string("s: ");
if (s == NULL)
{
    return 1
}

char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);

if (t == NULL)
{
    return 1; // malloc returns the first address of the char array, if memory is run out, malloc returns NULL
}

for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i <= n; i++) // i <= n will copy the last char '\0' from s to t
{
    t[i] = s[i];
}

this can be achived by strcpy(t, s)

free(t);
return 0;

#### valgrind

> valgrind ./memory

check memory related bugs 

int *x = malloc(sizeof(int)); 
int *y = malloc(3 * sizeof(int)); 

#### passing by value vs by reference

void swap(int a, int b) // by value

void swap(int *a, int *b) // by reference, input parameter should be the address of the variable
{
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;
}

int x = 1;
int y = 2;
swap(&x, &y) // &x is to get the address of x

#### get rid of cs50.h

<stdio.h>

int n;
printf("n: ");
scanf("%i", &n);
printf("n: %i\n", n);

#### discussion

pointers
address - value
0x500000 - 3 // this is a variable, int a = 3;
0x500004 - 0x500000 // this is a pointer, int *p = &a; int here means the pointer points to a integer.

key syntax
- type * is a pointer that stores the address of a type
- *x takes a pointer x and returns the value stored in that address
- &x takes x and gets its address

### Week 5 data structures

array , contagious
linked list, dynamic to add elements
