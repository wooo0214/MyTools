# Overview

Cyber security refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.   
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.   
Effective cyber security measures include multiple layers of protection spread across computers, networks, and programs. To be successful, an organizationâ€™s people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense against cyber threats.
