Data-driven subscriptions are intended for scenarios like:
- email monthly report to all current customers whose membership might change from one distribution to the next.
- distributing reports to a specific group of recipients based on predefined criteria, like sending a sales performance report to all of the sales managers in an organization.
- Automate the generation of reports in a wide variety of formats, for example .xlsx and .pdf.
