The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.

## Goals

- Reasoning and problem solving
- Knowledge representation
- Planning and decision making
- Machine Learning
- Natural language processing
- Perception
- Social intelligence
- General intelligence

## Techniques

AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.
- Search and optimization: AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.
    - State space search
    - Local search
- Logic
- Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning
- Classifiers and statistical learning methods
- Artificial neural networks
- Deep learning
- Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)

## Machine Learning
From perceptron, to convolution, and to neural network, and to convolutional neural network.
